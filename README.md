# fluent_python

Examples taken/adapted from the book [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/) by Luciano Ramalho.
These are the examples which demonstrate topics/ideas/patterns/syntax that I was not already familiar with and think would be good to integrate into my python vocab.
The book uses python 3.4, but these notebooks use python 3.8.
